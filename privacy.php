            to do that carefully and sensibly. This notice describes the privacy policy of Oldbooknewlife.com. By
            visiting
            Oldbooknewlife.com, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <h4>Controllers of Personal Information</h4>
        <p>Any personal information provided to or gathered by Oldbooknewlife Seller Services Private Limited under this

        <h4>What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon.in Gather?</h4>
        <p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience
            at Amazon.in. We use your information to assist sellers in handling orders, deliver products and services,
            process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our
            records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer
            reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this
            information to improve our platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third
            parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

            Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Information You Give Us:</span>We receive and store any information you enter
            on our website or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose
            not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
            We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future
            shopping for you, improving our platform, and communicating with you.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Automatic Information:</span>We receive and store certain types of information
            whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types
            of information when your Web browser accesses Amazon.in or advertisements and other content served by or on
            behalf of Amazon.in on other Web sites. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. We may
            also receive/store information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for
            your device. We may use this information for internal analysis and to provide you with location-based
            services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">E-mail Communications: </span> To help us make e-mails more useful and
            interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Amazon.in if your computer supports
            such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies in an effort to
            avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from
            us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Information from Other Sources:</span>We might receive information about you
            from other sources and add it to our account information.

            By using or continuing to use the site you agree to our use of your information (including sensitive
            personal information) in accordance with this Privacy Notice, as may be amended from time to time by
            Amazon.in in its discretion. You also agree and consent to us collecting, storing, processing, transferring
            and sharing information (including sensitive personal information) related to you with third parties or
            service providers for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Notice.

            We may be required to share the aforesaid information with government authorities and agencies for the
            purposes of verification of identity or for prevention, detection or investigation, including of cyber
            incidents, prosecution and punishment of offences. You agree and consent for Amazon.in to disclose your
            information, if so required, under applicable law.</p>

            <h4>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="my-1">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input in addition to maintaining security of your information as per the International Standard IS/ISO/IEC 27001 on "Information Technology Security Techniques Information Security Management System-Requirements".</li>
                <li class="my-1">We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</li>
                <li class="my-1">We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal information (including sensitive personal information). Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>
                <li class="my-1">It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Does Oldbooknewlife.com share the Information it receives?</h4>
            <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Amazon.in shares customer information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries which Amazon.com, Inc., controls and that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</span>We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.in or sell offerings to you at Amazon.in. In other cases, we provide services jointly with or on behalf of these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party.</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Third Party Service Providers:</span>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Promotional Offers: </span>Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon.in customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Business Transfers: </span>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Protection of Amazon.in and Others:</span>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with applicable law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Amazon.in, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies, organisations, government or regulatory authorities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">With your consent: </span>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
